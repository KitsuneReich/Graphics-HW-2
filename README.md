A scene in unity which has a bloom filter applied to the main camera, causing a white outline to radiate from the fantastic beast model. Additionally, there is an outline shader applied to this same model. This shader takes the normals from the mesh, dot products them with the cameria position, and applies a color based upon the normal to create the outlines upon the model.
